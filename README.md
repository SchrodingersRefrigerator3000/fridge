# Schrödinger's Refrigerator 3000
## Overview

The **Schrödinger Refrigerator 3000** is an advanced quantum-powered cooling system designed to manage the uncertainty of food states while preventing paradoxes in timeline-dependent storage environments. This repository contains source code for the quantum core modules, entropy management, cooling mechanisms, and timeline stabilization protocols.
